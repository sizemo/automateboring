Solutions to problems from the second edition of Automate the Boring Stuff 2e by Al Sweigart

As I go through and solve the practice problems at the end of the chapters, I want to include them here so that other people can see examples while they search.
Doing this has been helpful when I'm trying to come up with my own solutions. Good luck!
